The variant of the Breakout game that I found interesting can be found at https://www.crazygames.com/game/atari-breakout
This variant has almost all features described in the assignment assignment as it features different levels, powerups,
lives and scoring system.

For my game, each level will feature a harder block type which would take more hits to destroy. I would like to try to
create an algorithm which would randomly position blocks on the screen for each level, given the types of blocks used in
the level, so for level 1, easy blocks would be positioned randomly on the screen, for level 2 easy and medium blocks
would be positioned randomly on the screen. I might use a math.random algorithm with different weight values placed on
different block types.

The powerups that I want to create woudl be, adding an extra ball, increasing paddle size and increasing ball speed.

The cheat key I'd like to include adds an extra life, so that the levels could be completed with ease (especially useful
for debugging purposes).

The extra feature I'd like to add is an endless mode. If I succeed in an algorithm which randomly puts blocks on the
scene, I could easily modify this algorithm to work continuously inside the game loop.
